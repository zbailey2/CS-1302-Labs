    Implemented Loading Bill Data
    
    1)Updated saveBillData() to only save bill object items like server name and item list
      Since the numerical values for total are updated from the items, saving these values was not necessary

      Now tests for the amount of items, and the strings saved when certain bill items are saved to file
    3)Implemented a loadBillData() method in order to load a pre-existing bill
      Loads the current bill data into a bill to show in the javafx element
    4)Implemented UI elements for the loadBillData that will display the bill and update it
      Displays error for invalid file type and IOExceptions, only updates bill items.
    5) Implemented Testing for the loadBillData() method
       Theres ensure that the loadBillData() works as it is intended

      Is meant to save current information stored in the bill for the user.

      Is meant to allow the saveBillData() method in the model packages to be called in the javafx program when button is pressed
    3)Created testing for the saveBillData() method in a seperate testing package.
      This allows me to properly manage the saveBillData, and make sure it works as it is intended.
